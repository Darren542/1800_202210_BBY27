authentication
customized experience 
Why do I need to make an account? Maybe to create and join events 

focus on the user interaction

make your laptop ready to demo 

have your tabs open at the right place

don't show login and sign up
setup a common account
login before the demo

functions should have headers, two or three lines
what the function does and who calls it

the key lines should only be documented for "interesting" parts

readme that includes everything in the project folder
documented so that someone can read/modify what your did

focus on mobile
